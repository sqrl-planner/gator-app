# gator
Central dataset aggregator and content manager for sqrl planner

## Package manager
Gator uses the [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) package manager to manage its dependencies. To install the dependencies, run the following command:
```
poetry install
```
See the [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) documentation for more information and
installation instructions.

## Running the server
You'll need to have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

#### Clone this repo and move into the directory
```shell
git clone https://github.com/sqrl-planner/gator.git
cd gator
```

#### Copy starter files
```shell
cp .env.example .env
```
The defaults are for running in *development* mode. Go through each variable in the file and make sure it is properly set. You will likely need to update the credentials.

#### Build the Docker image and start the Docker container

You start the Docker container by running

*The first time you run this, it's going to take 5-10 minutes depending on your internet connection and hardware.*
```shell
docker-compose up
```
This will build the image, if needed, and once built, automatically spin up a container with the image. If you'd like to force a rebuild of the image, you may additionally pass an optional ``--build`` flag to the above command.

#### Stopping the Docker container

You can stop running the container by running ``docker-compose down``.

#### Setting up the database

gator uses MongoDB, a NoSQL database program. An instance of MongoDB is already setup for you (with a ``gator`` database) by the Docker container.

Alterntively, you can run an instance locally or use a number of database providers. If you do so, create an empty database on your MongoDB instance and update the ``.env`` file with your instance information (host, credentials, and db name).

#### Pulling and syncing data

If your database is empty, you'll need timetable information to use gator. To pull the latest data from all monitored repos, in the Docker container run
```shell
gator data pull
```
or outside the Docker container, run
```shell
docker-compose run web gator data pull
```

For more information on this command and the data CLI, see the [data cli](/docs/data_cli.md) documentation.

### Automating data syncing

The Docker container will automatically sync the data on the first-run. You might find it useful to setup a cron job to periodically run this job in production.

## Native Development Environment
If you prefer to work natively, rather than bootstrapping the application in a Docker container, see the [native development workflow](docs/develop-native.md) docs for setup instructions.

## Workflow Tools
We use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to automatically run the following tasks when you commit to your repository.

#### Linting the codebase
For detecting code quality and style issues, run
```
flake8
```
For checking compliance with Python docstring conventions, run
```
pydocstyle
```

**NOTE**: these tools will not fix any issues, but they can help you identify potential problems.


#### Formatting the codebase
For automatically formatting the codebase, run
```
autopep8 --in-place --recursive .
```
For more information on this command, see the [autopep8](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/autopep8) documentation.

For automatically sorting imports, run
```
isort .
```

#### Running tests
````
pytest
